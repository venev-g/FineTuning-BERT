# FineTuning-BERT
This repository demonstrates how to fine-tune the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for a custom text classification task using transfer learning. Leveraging pre-trained language representations, this project achieves accurate classification on domain-specific data with minimal training time.
